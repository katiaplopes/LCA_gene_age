Genomic phylostratigraphy is a statistical approach for reconstruction of macroevolutionary trends based on the principle of founder gene formation and punctuated emergence of protein families (Domazet-Loso et al 2007). Based on this methodology it's possible to determine the age for a given gene. The scripts presented here are from an integrative analysis that uses a human tissue RNASeq data, a database of orthologous proteins that allows finding the oldest relatives to each human protein along different species; the taxonomy mapping of genes to lineage clades from the NCBI Taxonomy database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy); and the time-scale mapping provided by TimeTree resource (www.timetree.org).
